Splunk's Threat Research Team has an incredible library of over 1000 detections in the Splunk's [Enterprise Security Content Updates](https://research.splunk.com/) library. You can use Marcus Ferrera and Drew Church's awesome [ATT&CK Detections Collector](https://github.com/splunk/attack-detections-collector) to pop out a handy HTML file of relevant ESCU detections for you to align with MITRE ATT&CK.
